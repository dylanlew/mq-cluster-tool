# mq-cluster-tool

The IBM MQ Cluster tool provides a way to query and visualize your IBM MQ clusters using a graph.
The tool is made of a set of Java applications that extracts IBM MQ cluster information and builds
a directed property graph using the Apache TinkerPop™ computing framework and its in-memory TinkerGraph
database. The graph can then be used with various open source or commercial tools to perform queries
against the graph and to visualize the IBM MQ clusters.
